abstract = {In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically detect sentiments on Twitter messages (tweets) that explores some characteristics of how tweets are written and meta-information of the words that compose these messages. Moreover, we leverage sources of noisy labels as our training data. These noisy labels were provided by a few sentiment detection websites over twitter data. In our experiments, we show that since our features are able to capture a more abstract representation of tweets, our solution is more effective than previous ones and also more robust regarding biased and noisy data, which is the kind of data provided by these sources.},

  abstract = "This paper describes the fifth year of the Sentiment Analysis in Twitter task. SemEval-2017 Task 4 continues with a rerun of the subtasks of SemEval-2016 Task 4, which include identifying the overall sentiment of the tweet, sentiment towards a topic with classification on a two-point and on a five-point ordinal scale, and quantification of the distribution of sentiment towards a topic across a number of tweets: again on a two-point and on a five-point ordinal scale. Compared to 2016, we made two changes: (i) we introduced a new language, Arabic, for all subtasks, and (ii) we made available information from the profiles of the Twitter users who posted the target tweets. The task continues to be very popular, with a total of 48 teams participating this year.",
